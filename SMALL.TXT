SMALL.FON - Small bit-mapped font for OS/2 PM

The fonts contained in SMALL.FON were created using the Font Editor
that was included in the OS/2 PM Softset (Version 1.2).  There are two
versions of the font: one for EGA (8 pt) and another for VGA (6 pt).
They can be installed like any normal PM font, and I've been able to use
them under both version 1.30.1 and OS/2 2.0 (Beta 6.177).

Included in this package you will find the support code necessary to
convert one or more .FNT files (created by FONTEDIT) into a single .FON 
file.  You must have the Microsoft Assembler (MASM), the resource compiler
(RC) and the linker (LINK) in order to do this build.

Any problems?  Send me a message to my CompuServe mailbox, 72607,3111.
